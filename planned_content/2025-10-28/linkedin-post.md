# 2026 Debt Maturity Wall: Strategic Refinancing Preparation Required

Hotel properties face significant debt maturity volumes in 2026 from financing originated during 2021-2022 low rate period. Properties must secure replacement financing at rates 300-400bp higher than original terms.

Refinancing challenges intensified by:

**Lender withdrawal:** Bank lending contracted significantly with many reducing hotel exposure. CMBS markets restricted parameters with higher coverage ratios and increased scrutiny.

**Performance requirements:** Current standards require 1.25x-1.35x debt service coverage vs 1.10x-1.20x previously. Revenue stability and operational efficiency assume greater importance.

**Market positioning:** Properties benefit from operational optimisation prior to lender engagement. Capital improvements demonstrating immediate operational benefits receive favourable evaluation.

Alternative structures including equity participation, sale-leaseback transactions, and mezzanine financing provide solutions for properties facing service increases.

Successful refinancing requires 12-18 months preparation including operational improvements, financial analysis, and lender engagement. Early preparation enables optimal terms negotiation.

Refinancing challenges create opportunities for investors with capital and operational expertise. Properties unable to achieve satisfactory refinancing may require capital partners or face disposition.
