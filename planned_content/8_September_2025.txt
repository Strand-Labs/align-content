Use Class Conversions: Unlocking Hidden Value in Underperforming Assets
Recent market conditions have intensified focus on value-add strategies, with use class conversions emerging as a powerful tool for repositioning underperforming assets. Strategic planning consent applications can significantly enhance asset value by opening new revenue streams and optimising operational efficiency.

Converting from traditional hospitality uses to mixed-use developments or alternative leisure formats often unlocks substantial upside potential, particularly when assets are acquired below rebuild cost. The key lies in identifying properties with strong underlying fundamentals but operational or structural challenges that mask their true potential. What planning opportunities have you identified in your current portfolio that could drive enhanced returns? At Align Partners, we specialise in implementing sophisticated asset management strategies that combine operational repositioning with strategic planning enhancements to achieve levered returns of 15% or higher.
