# West Midlands Hotels Outperform London: Regional Renaissance in UK Hospitality

July 2025 CoStar data shows West Midlands hotels recording the UK's strongest performance growth: occupancy +6% YoY, ADR +8%, RevPAR +17%. London achieved more modest growth: occupancy +0.9%, ADR +2.4%.

Birmingham climbed eleven places to rank ninth in Colliers' UK Hotels Market Index 2025, driven by corporate travel recovery and international connectivity improvements.

The performance divergence reflects structural factors: London faces new supply pressure whilst regional markets benefit from balanced supply-demand fundamentals and operational cost advantages.

Regional hotels operate with lower baseline costs for staffing, energy, and property rates whilst demonstrating superior revenue growth trajectories. Infrastructure investment including HS2 and Commonwealth Games legacy continues supporting West Midlands demand.

The data challenges conventional allocation strategies that concentrate on London hotel investment. Regional markets offer different risk-return profiles with lower entry multiples and stronger growth potential.
