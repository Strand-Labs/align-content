# Resort Asset Management: Mar Hall Transformation Case Study

Resort properties present complex operational challenges that extend beyond traditional hotel management. Mar Hall Hotel, Golf and Spa Resort's transformation demonstrates how systematic asset management creates value through coordinated improvements across multiple business units.

Acquired with investor partner Dutco, the 5-star Renfrewshire property required integration of accommodation, golf, spa, and events operations under unified management strategy.

Resort properties demand specialised expertise: golf course operations, spa management, events coordination, and accommodation services as integrated business functions. Revenue optimisation requires sophisticated pricing strategies across multiple customer segments and business units.

David Webster's 30-year operational experience includes managing European golf resorts including Powerscourt Hotel, Carton House, and the Belfry. Lisa King's project development background includes Formby Hall Golf Resort & Spa management.

The systematic approach focused on operational efficiency improvements, revenue management coordination, selective capital investment, and integrated marketing across business units. Resort success requires understanding how different customer segments utilise facilities and pricing services accordingly.
