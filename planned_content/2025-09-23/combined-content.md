### AHC 2025 Preview: The Three Questions Every Hotel Investor Should Ask

The Annual Hospitality Conference returns to Manchester Central Convention Complex on September 29-30, 2025, bringing together over 1,100 senior leaders from across the UK hospitality sector. The conference theme "Reset. Rebuild. Rise" reflects the industry's position following significant operational and financial pressures.

For hotel investors, AHC 2025 presents opportunities to evaluate market sentiment, assess capital allocation trends, and identify potential opportunities from direct engagement with industry leaders, asset owners, and transaction intermediaries.

Three strategic questions will dominate investor conversations at this year's conference.

#### Where Is Capital Actually Flowing?

AHC attracts the decision-makers responsible for capital deployment across the UK hospitality sector. Institutional investors, family offices, private equity firms, and debt providers will provide insight into current investment strategies and market appetite for different asset classes and geographic markets.

The £6.3bn investment volume achieved in 2024 demonstrates continued capital availability, but allocation patterns have shifted. Portfolio transactions dominated headlines whilst single-asset deals increased 48% year-on-year, indicating changing buyer preferences and opportunity sets.

Conference attendees include representatives from major capital sources including pension funds, insurance companies, and international investors seeking UK exposure. Direct conversations with these decision-makers provide insight into allocation strategies, return expectations, and market timing considerations.

Debt providers attending the conference can provide insight into lending parameters, refinancing conditions, and distressed situations. The current interest rate environment has altered debt availability and pricing, affecting transaction structures and investment returns.

#### How Are Operators Addressing Cost Pressures?

The £3.4bn cost increase affecting the hospitality sector creates operational challenges that require innovative solutions. Conference presentations and networking sessions will reveal how successful operators are managing wage inflation, energy costs, and regulatory compliance whilst maintaining service standards.

UKHospitality data showing 374 net closures in H1 2025 indicates that many operators struggle with current cost structures. However, professional management companies and sophisticated investors continue expanding operations, suggesting that operational expertise provides competitive advantages.

Conference attendees include hotel management companies, brand representatives, and operational specialists implementing solutions to cost pressures. Their experiences provide insight into scalable strategies for cost management, revenue optimisation, and operational efficiency.

Food and beverage operators, technology providers, and service companies attending AHC offer solutions for operational challenges. Understanding which technologies and services demonstrate measurable returns helps investors evaluate operational improvement opportunities.

#### What Opportunities Emerge from Market Disruption?

Market disruption creates opportunities for investors with capital availability and operational capabilities. Conference discussions will reveal which market segments, geographic regions, and transaction types offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.

Distressed situations, refinancing challenges, and operational difficulties affecting some market participants create acquisition opportunities for well-capitalised buyers. Conference networking provides access to intermediaries, advisers, and principals managing distressed situations.

Regional market performance differences, demonstrated by the West Midlands' superior growth compared to London, indicate opportunities for investors willing to consider markets beyond traditional focus areas.

Development opportunities, brand transitions, and operational improvements represent value-creation strategies that require specific expertise and capital deployment. Conference attendees include specialists in these areas who can provide insight into current market conditions and opportunity availability.

#### Strategic Networking Priorities

AHC provides access to decision-makers across the hospitality investment ecosystem. Strategic networking should focus on identifying potential transaction counterparties, service providers, and market intelligence sources.

Institutional investors attending include pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds evaluating hospitality allocation strategies. Understanding their investment criteria, return expectations, and market concerns helps identify potential partnerships or competition for opportunities.

Hotel owners, particularly those managing regional portfolios or specialty assets, provide insight into operational challenges and potential disposal considerations. Many significant transactions originate from direct relationships established through industry events.

Development finance specialists, construction companies, and professional service providers offer insight into project costs, delivery timelines, and market conditions affecting development opportunities.

#### Conference Intelligence Strategy

Effective conference participation requires preparation and strategic focus. Key sessions addressing investment trends, operational innovations, and market outlook provide valuable intelligence for investment decision-making.

Panel discussions featuring senior industry leaders offer unfiltered perspectives on market conditions, challenges, and opportunities. Questions from audience members often reveal concerns and priorities affecting market participants.

Exhibition areas include technology providers, service companies, and advisory firms whose client experiences provide insight into broader market trends and operational innovations gaining traction across the sector.

The conference provides opportunities to evaluate potential service providers, operational partners, and transaction intermediaries whose capabilities may be relevant for future investment activities.

AHC 2025 occurs at a crucial inflection point for UK hospitality investment. Market disruption, capital availability, and operational innovation create conditions for significant opportunities. However, success requires understanding market dynamics, operational requirements, and transaction structures that differentiate attractive investments from potential problems.
