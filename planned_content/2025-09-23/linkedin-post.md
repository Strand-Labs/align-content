Three strategic questions will dominate investor conversations:

**Where is capital actually flowing?** £6.3bn deployed in 2024 despite sector pressures. Portfolio deals dominated headlines, but single-asset transactions increased 48% YoY. Conference attendees include pension funds, insurance companies, and international investors revealing allocation strategies.

**How are operators addressing cost pressures?** £3.4bn sector cost increases created operational challenges. 374 net closures in H1 2025, yet professional managers continue expanding. Conference reveals which solutions demonstrate measurable returns.

**What opportunities emerge from market disruption?** Distressed situations, refinancing challenges, regional performance differences create acquisition opportunities for well-capitalised buyers with operational capabilities.
