# UK Hotel Investment: £6.3bn Deployed Despite £3.4bn Cost Shock

UK hotel investment reached £6.3bn in 2024 whilst the sector faced unprecedented cost pressures. UKHospitality data shows the autumn Budget added £3.4bn in costs, resulting in 84,000 job losses and 374 net closures in H1 2025.

Yet major capital continued deploying: Blackstone acquired 33 Village Leisure hotels, KKR and Baupost bought a 33-property Marriott portfolio, Starwood invested £800m in Radisson Edwardian assets.

The disconnect reflects market bifurcation. Operators implementing reactive cost-cutting often compromise long-term asset value. Well-capitalised investors with operational expertise can acquire quality assets at attractive entry points.

Three factors separate viable opportunities from value traps: location fundamentals in established markets, asset quality that supports repositioning, and management capability to execute turnaround strategies.

Market conditions favour investors with patient capital and operational capabilities over leveraged buyers facing refinancing constraints.
