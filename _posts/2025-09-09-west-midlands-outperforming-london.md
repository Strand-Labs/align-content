  Regional UK hotel markets are experiencing a performance divergence that challenges conventional investment assumptions. July 2025 data from CoStar shows the West Midlands recording the strongest growth rates in the UK: occupancy up 6% year-on-year, ADR increasing 8%, and RevPAR advancing 17%.

  London, by contrast, achieved occupancy growth of 0.9% and ADR growth of 2.4% over the same period. Whilst London maintained higher absolute performance levels—88.6% occupancy versus regional averages—the growth trajectory favours regional markets.

  This performance gap reflects structural factors that institutional investors are beginning to recognise in their allocation strategies.

  ## Supply-Demand Dynamics Drive Performance

  London faces increasing supply pressure from new hotel development. STR forecasts indicate RevPAR growth will be primarily demand-driven, with occupancy growth outpacing ADR as new supply increases market competition. The capital's hotel development pipeline continues expanding despite cost pressures affecting operations.

  Regional markets, particularly the West Midlands, benefit from more balanced supply-demand fundamentals. Birmingham climbed eleven places in Colliers' UK Hotels Market Index 2025 to rank ninth nationally, driven by occupancy strength, ADR growth, and recovering international and corporate travel demand.

  The West Midlands' performance stems from several factors: corporate travel recovery to manufacturing centres, leisure demand for regional attractions, and limited new supply relative to London's development activity.

  ## Cost Structure Advantages

  Regional markets offer operational cost advantages that become more pronounced during periods of sector-wide cost inflation. Staffing costs, energy expenses, and property rates remain lower in regional centres whilst revenue potential has increased significantly.

  The National Living Wage increase to £12.21 affects all markets equally, but regional hotels typically operate with lower baseline labour costs and more flexible staffing models. Property rates, whilst increasing sector-wide, remain substantially lower outside London.

  These cost advantages, combined with improving revenue performance, create attractive margin expansion opportunities for regional assets under professional management.

  ## Infrastructure Investment Supports Growth

  Government and private sector infrastructure investment continues supporting regional hotel demand. The West Midlands benefits from ongoing HS2 development, Commonwealth Games legacy effects, and manufacturing sector recovery following supply chain reshoring trends.

  Birmingham's corporate travel recovery reflects broader economic activity in the region's automotive, advanced manufacturing, and professional services sectors. International connectivity through Birmingham Airport supports business travel demand whilst regional leisure attractions drive weekend occupancy.

  London's infrastructure advantages remain significant, but regional centres increasingly offer connectivity and business facilities that meet corporate travel requirements at competitive pricing points.

  ## Investment Implications

  The performance divergence creates opportunities for investors seeking exposure to UK hospitality markets with different risk-return profiles. Regional assets typically trade at lower multiples than London properties whilst demonstrating superior growth trajectories.

  However, successful regional investment requires understanding local market dynamics, operational requirements, and demand drivers that differ substantially from London hotel operations.

  Regional hotels often require different management approaches, revenue strategies, and market positioning than London assets. Food and beverage operations, meeting facilities, and leisure amenities assume greater importance in regional markets where hotels serve broader community functions.

  ## Market Positioning Considerations

  The West Midlands' outperformance reflects broader trends affecting regional UK hotel investment. Corporate travel recovery, supply-demand rebalancing, and cost structure advantages create conditions favourable to regional market investment.

  Investors with operational expertise and regional market knowledge can identify assets benefiting from these trends. The combination of performance growth, cost advantages, and lower entry multiples presents opportunities for value creation through professional asset management.

  Regional markets require different skill sets and market understanding than London hotel investment. Success depends on identifying properties positioned to benefit from local demand drivers whilst implementing operational strategies appropriate to regional market characteristics.

  Market conditions support selective regional investment for investors with relevant operational capabilities and local market expertise. The current performance trends indicate regional markets merit increased allocation consideration within diversified UK hotel portfolios.

  # West Midlands Hotels Outperform London: Regional Renaissance in UK Hospitality

  July 2025 CoStar data shows West Midlands hotels recording the UK's strongest performance growth: occupancy +6% YoY, ADR +8%, RevPAR +17%. London achieved more modest growth: occupancy +0.9%, ADR +2.4%.

  Birmingham climbed eleven places to rank ninth in Colliers' UK Hotels Market Index 2025, driven by corporate travel recovery and international connectivity improvements.

  The performance divergence reflects structural factors: London faces new supply pressure whilst regional markets benefit from balanced supply-demand fundamentals and operational cost advantages.

  Regional hotels operate with lower baseline costs for staffing, energy, and property rates whilst demonstrating superior revenue growth trajectories. Infrastructure investment including HS2 and Commonwealth Games legacy continues supporting West Midlands demand.

  The data challenges conventional allocation strategies that concentrate on London hotel investment. Regional markets offer different risk-return profiles with lower entry multiples and stronger growth potential.
